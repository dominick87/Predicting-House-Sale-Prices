# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices

In this project, we start by using some techniques for cleaning, transforming, and selecting features. Then we explore two different approaches to model fitting and see how they work providing intuition for further model building.

The data we use is available [here](https://ww2.amstat.org/publications/jse/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt) as well as at this same repo.
